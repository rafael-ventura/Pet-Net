<h1> Pet-Net </h1>

<p> A prototype of a pet social media created as a project during my Web Developer class in College. Was my first contact with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and i thought that would be nice to have this here. <br> It was made just for a project presentation. But can be more than that! <br>

<h2>The objective was: </h2>
<p> Create a new social media based on my ideas and implement 3 functions. I choosed: </p>
<ol>
  <li> The Adopte Function </li>
  <li> The Register Dog Function </li>
  <li> The Profile("Meu Perfil") Function </li>
</ol>

<h2> How To Use Pet Net? </h2>
<p>You start creating a account by "crie_sua_conta.html" file located on "crie_sua_conta" paste. <br>
 I used LOCALSTORAGE proprieties to save users data during the presentation of the project </p>
 <p> You have to create a account and then log in </p>
 
 <h2> Function One </h2>
 <p> The Adopte is on "Adoção" and as it says, you can adopte an animal by sending a form to the site. 
  After this, your form is going to process </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Function Two </h2>
  <p> The Register it was meant to be for cats and dogs at first, but i just finished the dog register.<br>
  Its located on "Carteira de Vacinação". <br>
  After registering a dog, you can create his pet vaccination card. </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Function Three </h2>
  <p> The Profile Function its on "Meu Perfil" and is there where you can configure your profile informations. <br>
  There are two functions: One for change your informations other to erase your account(using the LOCALSTORAGE proprieties). </p>
